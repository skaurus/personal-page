&nbsp;  

Involved, hands-on, informal, like to leave everything better than it was, enjoy helping people and love finding optimal technical decisions.

As a contributor, I can design and ship new complex features, creating new revenue streams for the company from scratch. As a leader, I care about the people and am humble, empathic, patient, and kind. My goal is to teach and then not get in the way.

Created a great team at my startup and led it until an acquisition and beyond that. I ended up managing a team of about 70 people, but I felt more in my place managing 5-10 and writing code.

I’d like to go back to that level (developer or a team lead), and also learn new skills. For many years my main language was Perl, now it's Go, also I touched few other technologies briefly. I'm open to any stack, if you're willing to hire me without the relevant experience.

### Experience

**CTO**

Recsystems division of VK Group (former [Mail.Ru](http://Mail.Ru) Group)

Jun 2019 - current time

To be precise, Recsystems in the context of VK means Relap.io, [Pulse.Mail.Ru](http://Pulse.Mail.Ru) (Yandex.Zen rival), and Mediaprojects divisions of VK.

Pulse.Mail.Ru was transferred to our team management as part of the acquisition of Relap.io by VK, and Mediaprojects joined us two years later.

The size of my team initially doubled, and then grew even more, and my responsibilities changed drastically, from an acting coach to a proper manager. It wasn't easy.

They included:

- building processes like review 360
- building relationships between people and teams
- a lot of negotiations - between projects, with other VK divisions, external suppliers
- growth of my reports
- salary and hardware budgeting
- finding resources
- just a general problem-solving
- also, I architectured a new ad type that required integration between three services, with revenue of tens of thousands of dollars per month

I did mostly fine, but it was not fun at all.

Relap and Pulse both multiplied their traffic and revenue a few times over. For Mediaprojects, it is too early to say.

**CTO**

Surfingbird

Mar 2011 - Jun 2019

Surfingbird was our first project. It was a personal recommendation system, like StumbleUpon. In 2014 we created a side project - Relap, a recommendation system for publishers, like Taboola. This project took off like a hockey stick and since then we worked only on it.

Both projects were fun to work on, significantly because we had to solve technical challenges using very modest resources.

Relap took most of the Russian market share, and successfully fought off rivals like Taboola, Outbrain, Plista, Giraffe, Mail.Ru, and Yandex.

I’m especially proud of the great team retention and working atmosphere.

Surfingbird was featured in [Russian Forbes](https://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/internet-i-svyaz/233917-kak-russkie-programmisty-prevratili-internet-serfing-v-razvlechen) (I’m on the right), [Kommersant’s “The Firm's Secret”](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1816958) (Kommersant is one of Russia's leading business newspapers) and other online outlets, and got a grant from Startup Fellows (Pavel Durov & Yuri Milner).

Relap was named one of the 100 hottest European startups by [Wired in 2015](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/100-hottest-european-startups-2015-moscow).

In the end, it was acquired by [Mail.Ru](http://Mail.Ru) Group (now VK) where the management was obligated to work for 3 more years.

- under my leadership, we created the biggest native ad platform in Russia on a couple of dozens of servers, which also generated billions of content recommendations per month

I personally:

- made video ad platform from scratch with revenues of tens of thousands of dollars per month
- revamped big chunks of the system, like an entire ad auction system, to make them faster and clearer to enable further development
- implemented eCPM prediction engine that raised revenues by 20% and reduced supply usage for predict learning by 30% by eliminating some loopholes
- implemented context targeting system in a week without new hardware resources
&nbsp;  
&nbsp; 

**Perl developer**

Nov 2010 - Feb 2011

I worked on the Direct, system for creating and managing contextual search ads in the Yandex search engine. Then we got funding for our startup, and I left.

- changed client report generation from on-the-fly to queued to get rid of timeouts and be able to generate bigger reports
- implemented “targeted phones” feature to measure ads effectiveness
- participated in the development of geo-targeted ads
